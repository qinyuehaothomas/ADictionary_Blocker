## My Project!:
<h2> <b>ADictionary Blocker!!</b> </h2>

***Reason :***
> Theres online reserch in school, **in english**.
> And my brain become jellly when i am reading.
> I **Don't** want to go back and forth for words.

***Functions :***
> You can search word by just **clicking** on it!
> You can add it to your **wordlist**!
> Ads will be replaced with word from your wordlist
> to help you **revise**

**Files**
> there's only  single file called *ADictionary_Blocker_V5*
> which will be installed in Tampermonkey / Geasermonkey to implyment the functions

#  Lets watch the [Video](https://youtu.be/w1yiLb6y1Ok "It sucks,I know")!

**Source of idea and code**
**I combinde and modify them**
> The part of getting selected word is from a service in [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/doubleclick.html )
> The ad-finding part if from a github project
> The api for dictionary is from [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/ )


##  Here's how to use it:

1. Download the code to ***Tampermonkey / Geasermonkey*** OR [Click this](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/432144-adictionary-blocker/code/ADictionary%20Blocker.user.js) to finish in one step (if you have intsalled Tampermonkey / Geasermonkey)
1. Enable it,
1. Click on any word you don't know on any page(Some does not work...)
1. if you want to add to wordlist:
    1. click the grey tick.

## Now you have a breif idea on how to use it

## Some Thoughts

> **I only put a little words for my project discriptions since i am really, really bad at writing essays.**
> **So, i decided to spend my time on  this part which is easier for me to write longer things.**
> I learnt a bit of coding before taking the course
> but this course really changed my view to the computer world.
> The course teach me more in ways of problem solving and computer thinking.
> I also picks up some useful skills like C and SQL alone the road.
> The course brings me to another level in computer.
> All the time on the course is an unforgetable journey.
> I feel really great being able to put my ideas into reality,all thanks to the course.
> The year end exam of school is very near when i am typing this, i rush throught the questions within a week.
> I will also move on to other courses in this series. I already registerd for the CS50 AI course.
> I learnt a lot of new stuffs from the course which i believe i will always remember.

> A Thank You to all the teachers in this wonderful learning journey.
